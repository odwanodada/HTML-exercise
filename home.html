 <p>BMW GROUP'S UNIQUE CORPORATE CULTURE.
    What makes our corporate culture so unique? Our passion! Because 
    someone who does great things day after day doesn’t just have a 
    job – they have a calling.

    We make the difference.
    “We” to us means acting together, inspiring each other and giving 
    each other support. It’s precisely this 'we - mentality' that characterises 
    our passion for vehicles and technology, and allows us to write a piece of 
    automotive history every day. Whether it be research, development, marketing
    or production - at the BMW Group teamwork is essential when it comes to 
    shaping the mobility of the future. We live trust and appreciation across 
    all divisions and across all hierarchies, because we know that revolutionary
    innovations and unique products can only develop in an extraordinary corporate 
    culture.
