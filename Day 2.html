 <p><b>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper, 
songwriter, and record producer. He is regarded by many critics and 
contemporaries as one of the most important and influential rappers of 
his generation, and as one of the greatest rappers of all time.[1][2][3][4]
Raised in Compton, California, Lamar embarked on his musical career as a teenager 
under the stage name K-Dot, releasing a mixtape that garnered local attention and 
led to his signing with indie record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE).
He began to gain recognition in 2010 after his first retail release, Overly 
Dedicated. The following year, he independently released his first studio album, 
Section.80, which included his debut single "HiiiPoWeR". By that time, he had 
amassed a large online following and collaborated with several prominent hip hop artists, 
including The Game, Busta Rhymes, and Snoop Dogg.</b></p>

<p><i>Lamar's major label debut album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, was released in 2012 by TDE, 
Aftermath, and Interscope Records to critical acclaim. It debuted at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard
200 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA. The record contained the top 40 singles "Swimming Pools (Drank)",
"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe", and "Poetic Justice". His critically acclaimed third album To Pimp a Butterfly
(2015) incorporated elements of funk, soul, jazz, and spoken word. It debuted atop the charts in the U.S. 
and the UK, and won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 58th ceremony. In 2016, Lamar released Untitled 
Unmastered, a collection of unreleased demos that originated during the recording sessions for To Pimp a Butterfly. 
He released his fourth album, Damn, in 2017 to further acclaim; its lead single "Humble" topped the U.S. Billboard 
Hot 100 chart, while the album itself became the first non-classical and non-jazz album to be awarded the Pulitzer 
Prize for Music.[5]</i></p>
